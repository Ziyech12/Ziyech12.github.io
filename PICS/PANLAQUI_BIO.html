    <h2 id="childhood">Childhood Years.</h2>
    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my childhood years, I was a weird kid.<sup>1</sup> When I was a kid, I used to stay inside of the house not playing or socialize with other kids outside of their home.<sup>2</sup> So when I was inside of my home, I always play on my Gameboy advance and play some Pokemon, Mario Kart, and some Harry Potter games.<sup>3</sup>
    One day my Dad bought me a Playstation 2 with a game called FIFA.<sup>4</sup> It's a Football simulation game that releases every year with a new FIFA game.<sup>5</sup> My Dad and I played it all day long with my dad.<sup>6</sup> Next one is the Gamecube that was own of my cousin, and we played Mario Kart Double Dash and Super Smash Bros Melee.<sup>7</sup> During those time, I communicate so few people during in grade school.<sup>8</sup> For me I want to approach to them, to give me some boost of confidence to communicate with others during those time.<sup>9</sup> And during my childhood years, I was transferred within around 3 times for I can remember in Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 6.<sup>10</sup> In grade 2, I was moved to a catholic school that was really new at that time and I have a really great time on that school.<sup>11</sup> In 3rd grade, I was transferred again in a different catholic school that was popular here in Tondo.<sup>12</sup> In 6th grade, I was transferred in a public school in Quezon City, and it was new for me to be in a new view in a public school that was in private school in all of my childhood days.<sup>13</sup> During these times I was a little bit lazy in 6th grade.<sup>14</sup> Maybe because that time it was back to zero to get some friends again, or maybe a new city that we were living in my grandparents house.<sup>15</sup> So during that time in 5th grade it was really awkward for me to see them that a new transfer student coming from a private school, thinking that we were rich.<sup>16</sup> This was the time to find a high school for the next school year.<sup>17</sup> There were 2 choices for me, 1st is the manuel roxas high school, and 2nd is the Roces Sr. Science Vocational High School.<sup>18</sup> I wanted to go in Roces, because it's really short from my grandparents home to that school and it was one of the most popular school in Quezon City.<sup>19</sup> As I take the entracnce exam it was very easible to me to answer them and to get in Roces, and after a few weeks, I saw myself in the board that I pass the entrance exam and I was very happy for me and my parents.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in my first year in high school I was super excited to be in the high school life.<sup>1</sup> After a few months in 1st year, I got dengue in the campus.<sup>2</sup> I was hospitalized arouind 3 weeks and found out that I have a hypertension in the age of 13 years old.<sup>3</sup> I was shocked and cannot handle my blood pressure becuase of the heat in the campus and the school hours.<sup>4</sup> It was around 7:00 AM start of school and ends in 4:00 pm, I cannot handle it, because my blood presure was super annoying for me to learn and concentrate.<sup>5</sup> During those time in 1st year, I was leaving around 12pm mainly becasue of my high blood pressure was always high during those days.<sup>6</sup> So I mainly got horrific grades that needs to go in summer school to get in shape.<sup>7</sup> In my 2nd year, Still having the same issues.<sup>8</sup> But my adviser during that time was so very helpful to me to get back in shape and my other teachers also help me. <sup>9</sup> During also in 2nd year, there's a time to choose a vocational course to do that will be stuck in 2nd up to 4th year. <sup>10</sup> I choose Electronics, Computer Systems, and Welding.<sup>11</sup> I got welding, so when the first day of vocational classes, I met my classmates and make freinds with them at the first day.<sup>12</sup> During those time we were welding scraping metals in the campus and it was very fun to do work inside the campus and learn about welding in general.<sup>13</sup> In my 3rd year, it was very horrific time again.<sup>14</sup> And also in my 4th year, it was very hard to get back mainly because, theres a change in my environment that I faced and struggled.<sup>15</sup> So searching in Senior high school, I choose to go in Arellano University to learn ICT, beacuse of this time I was into in computer hardwares and programming, because it was very interesting on how computers work in hardware and in software.<sup>16</sup> In the first day in Senior high, I said to myself that time to change my habit, to learn more and exceed in this course.<sup>17</sup> So I did that, I exceed my grades in the course and even compete in programming challenges in the campus and got 2nd place.<sup>18</sup> In my 12th grade I was searching to a new university to start in college, my choices were Arellano to stay, UE, or PLM.<sup>19</sup> I chose UE mainly because, I want new atmosphere in my college and in PLM I didn't pass my entrance exam.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
